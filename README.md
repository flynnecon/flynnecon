- 👋 Hi, I’m @flynnecon
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersections of demographic and economic analysis and research. I teach classes in statistics, population analysis, data visualization, forecasting, and others. 
- 🌱 I’m constantly looking at learning new code. My teaching uses R and Stata for code. I am debating learning some Python but I am not sure about that yet. 
- 💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on interesting research ideas and applications of economic and demographic analysis.
- 📫 You can reach me at flynn.economics@gmail.com, or @barterisevil on Twitter.
