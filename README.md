- 👋 Hi, I’m David Flynn ( @flynnecon )
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersections of demographic and economic analysis and research. I teach classes in statistics, population analysis, data visualization, forecasting, and a few other areas. . 
- 🌱 I’m constantly looking at learning new code. My teaching uses R and Stata for code along with Excel at times in the introductory level classes. I am debating learning some Python but I am not sure about that yet. 
- 💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on interesting research ideas and applications of economic and demographic analysis.
- 📫 You can reach me at david.flynn@und.edu, or @barterisevil on BlueSky.
